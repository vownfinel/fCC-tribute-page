      <h3 id="headline2">Early life & Career</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Robert Kiyosaki was born to Ralph H Kiyosaki in Hilo, Hawaii. He had a Japanese American ancestry. His father was a teacher and instructor by profession, which enabled young Kiyosaki to attend better educational institutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          He attained his preliminary education from Hilo High School, after which he enrolled at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in New York, graduating from the same as a deck officer in 1969.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1972, during the Vietnam War, he served as a helicopter gunship pilot in the Marine Corps. For his service, he was awarded with the Air Medal. Two years later, he left the Marine Corps. However, instead of returning to Hawaii he moved to New York.
        </li>
        <li>
          From 1974 until 1978, he took up the profile of a salesman for Xerox Corporation selling copy machines. Meanwhile in 1977, having saved enough money, he started a company of his own that brought forth to the market the first nylon and Velcro ‘surfer’ wallets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite reaching the rock bottom pit low mark of his life, he did not lose hope and instead used his experience and knowledge to help people and educate them on how to avoid bankruptcy and achieve financial success.
        </li>
        <li>
          He began working as a motivational speaker for a personal growth seminar business called Money and You, along with D.C Cordova. The three-day seminar mostly focussed on teaching students the works of Buckminster Fuller. Predominantly present only in Canada and United States, the popularity of the business allowed them to spread their wings to Australia and New Zealand as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following the footsteps of his educator ‘poor dad’, and guidance and advice of his ‘rich dad’ (who in reality was his friend’s dad) he concentrated on amalgamating the two lines of beliefs to come up with a book which highlighted the teaching of both his rich dad and poor dad. He collaborated with Sharon Lechter and together they co-wrote the first ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ book. However, they could not find a publisher for the same and hence decided on publishing it on their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, published in 2000, advocates financial independence and teaches its readers the importance of building wealth through investments in real estate and the starting and owning of business. The book sold ten million copies becoming a bestseller.
        </li>
        <li>
          The success of the book led to the release of the future works, Rich Dad's CASHFLOW Quadrant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing. Furthermore, he released a dozen of other books.
        </li>
